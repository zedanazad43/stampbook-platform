#  Stampcoin Platform - Deployment Summary |  

**Generated**: 2025  
**Status**:  Ready for Production Deployment

---

##  CI/CD Automation |  

| Workflow | Platform | Trigger | File |
|----------|----------|---------|------|
| **   Railway** | Railway (Backend) | Push  `main` | `.github/workflows/railway-deploy.yml` |
| **Deploy to GitHub Pages** | GitHub Pages (Frontend) | Push  `main` | `.github/workflows/pages.yml` |

###  Required Secrets |  

Add these in **GitHub  Settings  Secrets and variables  Actions**:

| Secret | Description | Platform |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `RAILWAY_TOKEN` | Railway API token (from Railway dashboard) | Railway |

Add these in the **Railway service dashboard**:

| Variable | Description | Value |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| `SYNC_TOKEN` | Secret token for API authentication | Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `PORT` | Server port (auto-set by Railway) | `8080` |

###    Workflow 

To delete a workflow from the repo:
```bash
git rm .github/workflows/<filename>.yml
git commit -m " workflow "
git push
```

##  Website Status

###  GitHub Pages (Live)

**URL**: https://zedanazad43.github.io/stp/

**Status**: 
-  Automatically deployed from `main` branch
-  GitHub Actions workflow configured (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`)
-  HTTPS enabled by default
-  Custom domain ready

**How it works**:
1. Push to `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions triggers `.github/workflows/pages.yml`
3. Site is built and deployed automatically
4. Live within 1-2 minutes

**No action required** - Website is already live!

##  Backend API - Deployment Options

Your backend is ready for deployment on **5 different platforms**. Choose one:

###  Recommended: Railway (CI/CD Automated)

**Why Railway?**
-  Easiest setup (3 commands)
-  Free credits: $5/month
-  Automatic HTTPS
-  Persistent storage included
-  Perfect for small to medium apps
-  **Auto-deploy via GitHub Actions on every push to `main`**

**CI/CD Setup** (one-time):
1. Create account at https://railway.app
2. Create a new project and copy your `RAILWAY_TOKEN`
3. Add `RAILWAY_TOKEN` to GitHub Secrets
4. Set `SYNC_TOKEN` and `PORT=8080` in Railway dashboard
5. Every subsequent push to `main` deploys automatically!

**Manual Quick Start** (if needed):
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway up
```

**Cost**: $0-10/month  
**Time to Deploy**: 2-3 minutes

**Result**: `https://stampcoin-platform.railway.app/sync`

---

### Option 2: Render (Free Tier)

**Best for**: Free hosting with auto-sleep

```
1. Go to render.com
2. New  Web Service
3. Connect GitHub  zedanazad43/stp
4. Deploy
```

**Cost**: Free (with limitations) or $7/month  
**Time to Deploy**: 3-5 minutes

**Result**: `https://stampcoin-api.onrender.com/sync`

---

### Option 3: Vercel (Serverless)

**Best for**: API routes and edge computing

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

**Cost**: Free (personal) or $20/month  
**Time to Deploy**: 1-2 minutes

**Result**: `https://stampcoin-platform.vercel.app/sync`

---

### Option 4: Fly.io (Global)

**Best for**: Global distribution and scaling

```bash
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
fly launch
fly deploy
```

**Cost**: Free tier available, then $2-5/month  
**Time to Deploy**: 3-5 minutes

**Result**: `https://stampcoin-platform.fly.dev/sync`

---

### Option 5: Heroku (Legacy)

**Note**: Free tier removed in 2022 (requires credit card)

**Cost**: $7/month minimum  
**Time to Deploy**: 2-3 minutes

##  Complete Deployment Steps (Railway Example)

### Step 1: Install Railway CLI
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

### Step 2: Login to Railway
```bash
railway login
# Opens browser for authentication
```

### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
cd stp
railway up
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment
```bash
# Get your project ID from the prompt
# Set environment variable in Railway dashboard:
#   SYNC_TOKEN = your-secret-token-here
```

### Step 5: Verify
```bash
curl -X GET https://your-railway-domain.railway.app/sync \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token"

# Should return: {"todos":[]}
```

---

##  Security Setup

### Generate Secure Token
```bash
# macOS/Linux
openssl rand -base64 32

# Windows PowerShell
[Convert]::ToBase64String((1..32|ForEach-Object{[byte](Get-Random -Min 0 -Max 256)}))
```

### Environment Variables to Set

On your chosen platform:

```
SYNC_TOKEN=<your-generated-token>
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080 (usually auto-set)
```

##  After Deployment

### Update README

Add your deployed API URL to README.md:

```markdown
##  Live Services

- **Website**: https://zedanazad43.github.io/stp/
- **API**: https://your-platform-url.com/sync
```

### Monitor Your Services

- **Website**: GitHub Actions  Deploy to GitHub Pages
